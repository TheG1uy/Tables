i love you
i hate you
i want you
i want you to leave me alone
you are wonderful
you are hurtful
you are true and false
the list goes on as do the owners of the words
the men who have held your hand and walk you through experience
some short some long
now add my name
for here are my words
you are a miracle
you are the eye of the storm
you are the smell of honey to a bee swarm
you are Helen of Troy
you are a young boy dream
you are the feel of a win to a losing team
you are paradise
you are a bucket of gold in 1849
you are that first sip of an exquisite wine
you are a hole in one on a par five
you are a light to a Cuban cigar
